    "q1": "How long does it take to build a web app?",
    "a1": "<p>It depends on the project. Thanks to my experience and tools, I work fast and efficiently.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li>- Single-page landing — 2–5 days</li><li>- Small website with 3–5 pages and responsive layout — 5–10 days</li><li>- CRM or admin panel with roles and authorization — from 10 working days</li></ul><p>Timeframes are discussed in advance and always met.</p><p>*The timeline may vary depending on the features and integrations you need.</p>",

    "q2": "What does the development process look like?",
    "a2": "<p><strong>The process is transparent and consists of several stages:</strong></p><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside mt-2\"><li>1. We define your goals, needs, and budget</li><li>2. We analyze existing design or create a structure from scratch</li><li>3. I plan the architecture — both visual and technical</li><li>4. Development stage: frontend and/or backend</li><li>5. Testing and demo access if needed</li><li>6. Launch and deployment to the server</li></ol><p class=\"mt-2\"><strong>After launch, you’ll be able to manage content independently:</strong></p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li>- via a simple admin panel</li><li>- via a CRM with roles, filters, export, and change history</li><li>- via an editable JSON file — a budget-friendly solution</li></ul><p>You stay updated throughout the process — from planning to launch.</p>",

    "q3": "Can you help with design too?",
    "a3": "<p>Yes. If you don’t have a design yet — I collaborate with a skilled UI/UX designer with 7 years of experience.</p><p>We can create a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface tailored to your audience and business goals.</p><p>From wireframes and prototypes to full visual design — everything can be done before development starts.</p><p class=\"mt-2\">You can check out his portfolio here: <a href=\"https://oleksandr-malik.webflow.io/\" target=\"_blank\">See profile</a></p>",

    "q4": "What if I need changes later?",
    "a4": "<p>Minor edits (like design tweaks or text updates) after project delivery are free.</p><p>More advanced or long-term improvements can be agreed upon separately.</p><p>I’m always open to cooperation at any stage.</p>",

    "q5": "How do you ensure website security?",
    "a5": "<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li>- Secure HTTPS connection by default</li><li>- Best practices for protecting APIs and forms</li><li>- Basic anti-brute-force and spam protections</li><li>- Regular backups and access control</li><li>- Reliable VPS hosting (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc.)</li><li>- Following OWASP recommendations and regular dependency updates</li></ul>",

    "a9": "<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li>- I’m always in touch</li><li>- Focused on quality and long-term results</li><li>- I don’t chase trends — I solve real business problems</li><li>- I help optimize your budget and offer flexible solutions</li><li>- I work as a partner, not just a coder</li></ul><p>Your satisfaction matters to me — and I want you to come back again.</p>",

    "q10": "How are you different from other freelancers?",
    "a10": "<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li>- I don’t disappear or delay deadlines</li><li>- I think both like a developer and a product-minded partner</li><li>- I offer flexible development: start small and scale later</li><li>- I value long-term cooperation over one-time gigs</li></ul>",
